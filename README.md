# Bootstrap Portfolio

---

## Description

Welcome to my updated portfolio website! I've revamped the site using Bootstrap, maintaining the same overall design while introducing some enhancements. Here's what's new.

## Key Features

**Introduction**

The navigation bar has retained its previous design, but was recreated by applying the correct Bootstrap classes to the HTML. It also has been supplemented with a link to a new section on the page and a button leading to the resume file. Links have been fine-tuned to navigate you through dedicated sections about me, my work, and ways to connect. The smooth scrolling remains, adding a touch of professionalism to the user experience.

For the hero section jumbotron was recreated using apropriate classes from Bootstrap v.5.3. You'll find my recent photo and my name here.

**Main Content**

In the Work section, you'll find a showcase of my projects presented in a grid using Bootstrap cards. Every image remains a gateway to the deployed applications. Although the hover effect for them was slightly changed.

A new skills section has been added, listing out the skills I expect to learn from the Bootcamp course.

In the footer you can find duplicate links to sections of the page and also to the resume file.

## Responsive Design

The layout continues to adapt seamlessly to various devices â€” desktops, tablets, or smartphones. Bootstrap's inherent responsiveness ensures a visually pleasing and user-friendly experience across different screens.

All hyperlinks now feature a hover effect, and buttons across the site display a subtle box shadow upon hover, adding responsiveness and interactivity.
